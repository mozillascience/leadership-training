# Mozilla 101

We’re building a better Internet.

Our mission is to promote openness, innovation & opportunity on the Web.

At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers and builders working together to keep the Internet alive and accessible, so people worldwide can be informed contributors and creators of the Web. We believe this act of human collaboration across an open platform is essential to individual growth and our collective future.
